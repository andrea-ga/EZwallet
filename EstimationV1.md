# Project Estimation - CURRENT
Date: 04/21/2023

Version: v1-just testing


# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWallet  project in CURRENT version (as received by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size


### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of modules to be developed   |             12                |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC    |71   |                            | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 852  |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |        86                |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 2580 | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |        2 days   and 3 hours         |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| estimate by size |  86 | 2 days and 3 hours|
| estimate by product decomposition | 309 |  2 weeks | 
| estimate by activity decomposition | 345 | 2 weeks and 2 days  |
